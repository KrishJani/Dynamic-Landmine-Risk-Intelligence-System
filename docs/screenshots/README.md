- **How to capture**: 
  1. Open the app at https://dynamic-landmine-risk-heatmap.streamlit.app/
  2. Take a full-page screenshot of the main dashboard
  3. Ensure the heatmap, sidebar controls, and metrics are visible

### 2. Model Performance (`model-performance.png`)
- **What to capture**: The sidebar showing model metrics and feature importance
- **How to capture**:
  1. Focus on the sidebar with model summary
  2. Include the feature importance bar chart
  3. Show the performance metrics (AUC, Accuracy, etc.)

### 3. SHAP Explanations (`shap-explanations.png`)
- **What to capture**: The SHAP explanations section
- **How to capture**:
  1. Check the "Show SHAP explanations (sample)" checkbox

  3. Include the success message showing SHAP values shape

### 4. Risk Distribution (`risk-distribution.png`)
- **What to capture**: The risk distribution histogram
- **How to capture**:
  1. Scroll down to the "Predicted risk distribution" section
  2. Capture the histogram showing risk probability distribution

### 5. Feature Importance (`feature-importance.png`)
- **What to capture**: The feature importance bar chart
- **How to capture**:
  1. Focus on the "Top feature importances (Random Forest)" section
  2. Capture the horizontal bar chart

### 6. Cross-Validation Results (`cross-validation.png`)
- **What to capture**: Any cross-validation visualization (if available)
- **How to capture**:
  1. Look for CV results in the model summary
  2. Capture any performance consistency visualizations

## Screenshot Guidelines

- **Resolution**: Use high-resolution screenshots (at least 1920x1080)
- **Format**: Save as PNG for best quality
- **File naming**: Use the exact filenames specified above
- **Content**: Ensure all text is readable and UI elements are clearly visible
- **Browser**: Use Chrome or Firefox for consistent rendering

2. Save them in this directory with the exact filenames
3. The README will automatically display them when you push to GitHub

## Alternative: Using the Live App

If you prefer, you can also:
1. Visit the live app: https://dynamic-landmine-risk-heatmap.streamlit.app/
2. Take screenshots directly from the deployed version
3. This ensures the screenshots match exactly what users will see
